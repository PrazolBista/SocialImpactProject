# SocialImpactProject
The project has three divisible stages.
1. Identify a problem
2. Come up with a feasible solution
3. Prototyping 

## Identify a Problem
At the stage of problem identification, brainstorming with the team and documentation were the strategy. The identified problem is human-elephant conflict. The project idea is biased with the geographical location of the team members. Countries in south-southeast Asia considered human-elephant conflict as an unsolvable problem and it has not been addressed appropriately over decades. 

1. Lost of both human and Elephants' lives.
2. Tourist get hit while exploring the rural areas.
3. Transportation service blockages.
4. Farmers directly affected.

## Come up with a feasible solution
As a feasible and affordable solution, An elephant tracking platform can be implemented. The main technical vertical will be IoT. The collected data will be retrieved to a cloud infrastructure and then using the exact locations and flows of the elephants. An app can be developed to warn people accordingly. There are some obstacles to be cleared.

1. If we use a wearable device to elephant, It would be harmful for the creature.
2. The need of power consumption of the device has to be fulfilled. A power harvesting method should be implemented.

## Prototyping
To be continued...
